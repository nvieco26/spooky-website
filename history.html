<h1 style="color:orange">Learn about the history of Halloween here</h1>
<p1 style="color:gray">How did Halloween start? It is a question many a trick-or-treater has asked, and one that is easily answered. Long ago, there was an ancient Celtic festival called 'Samhain'. This festival consisted of people dressing up and lighting bonfires to scare away malicious spirits such as ghosts or ghouls that they believed were roaming around. Eventually, the Celts were conquered by the Romans, who added to the tradition of Samhain with their own traditions, one of which had something to do with apples (which may explain the origins of bobbing for apples). Much later, the Christian church made November 2nd All Souls' Day to honor the deceased. They were attempting to replace Samhain with their own holiday. They did, but eventually the traditions of Samhain came back. October 31st became known as All-Hallow's Eve which later became Halloween, and that was also the day on which it was traditionally celebrated thousands of years earlier. Eventually it spread to America, where it became what it is today.</p>
