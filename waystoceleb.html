    <h1 style="background-color: orange;">There are many ways to celebrate this holiday. The most popular ways are down below.</h1>
   <p>The most popular way to celebrate Halloween involves handing out candy to trick-or-treaters or, depending if you want to, going trick-or-treat yourself. This activity invloves dressing up as something and going from house to house saying "Trick or Treat" to which the person inside will either reply with "sorry, we don't have any candy" or they will just hand out the candy.</p>
  <p>Another way of celebrating the season of ghosts and ghouls is watching a classic Halloween movie with friends and/or family. Some recommended flicks include The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sr Pelo's "Spooky Month" series, IT, and The Conjuring.</p>
  <p>You can also carve jack-o-lanterns from pumpkins. You can look online for instructions on how to make your perfect jack-o-lantern. This classic Halloween tradition involves placing a candle within a carved pumpkin (designed to look like a face, perhaps like a monster or a skeleton) so that it glows at night and leaving it outside.</p>
  <p>Finally, you can also visit a corn maze. These are a staple of fall, and they are fun to do with friends and family, going through the many ears of corn and getting lost. Make sure you don't get too lost, though, 'cause then you might have to give the fire department a call.</p>
